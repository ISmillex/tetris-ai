## How It Works

Tetris-Ai is built using Svelte Kit, which allows for efficient rendering and smooth UI interactions. The game mechanics follow the classic Tetris rules, where players aim to complete lines by moving and rotating falling Tetrominoes. The time complexity of the game algorithms is optimized for smooth gameplay, ensuring minimal lag and smooth rendering even on lower-end devices. The space complexity is also optimized to efficiently handle the game grid and falling pieces, ensuring a seamless gaming experience. Implementing the AI aims to provide players with a challenging and competitive environment, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
